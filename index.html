      <h2>Queen Elizabeth’s Death Comes at Moment of Great Uncertainty for Britain</h2>
      <h5>Written by Karylle L. Lopez</h5>
      <p>Published Sept. 8, 2022  | Updated Sept. 9, 2022, 3:32 p.m.</p>
      <br>
      <p>LONDON — Queen Elizabeth II, whose seven-decade reign made her the only sovereign that most Britons had ever known, died on Thursday at her summer estate in Scotland, thrusting a bereaved country into a momentous transition at a time of political and economic upheaval.
        <br><br>
        The queen’s death at Balmoral Castle, announced by Buckingham Palace at 6:30 p.m., elevated her eldest son and heir, Charles, to the throne. He is Britain’s first king since 1952, taking the name King Charles III.</p>

      <h5>Written by Karylle L. Lopez</h5>
      <p>Published Sept. 8, 2022  | Updated Sept. 9, 2022, 4:26 p.m.</p>
      <p>When Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation in 1953 became the first to be broadcast live, many viewers had bought a television specifically for the event.
        <br><br>Further technological revolutions would roll along, and the British monarchy, despite its renowned reverence for tradition, would embrace the accelerating changes — though not always immediately.</p>
